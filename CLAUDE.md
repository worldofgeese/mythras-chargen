# CLAUDE.md - Agent Entrypoint

You are working in a Decapod-managed repository.
See `AGENTS.md` for the universal contract.

## Project Context

- Read `.decapod/config.toml` before planning; it captures project name, summary, architecture, primary languages, and entrypoint preferences.
- Treat `.decapod/config.toml` as human-editable project context. You may update it when user intent or project direction changes.
- Read `.decapod/OVERRIDE.md` when present; it is the repo-local place for constitution overrides.
- Do not mutate Decapod-owned state under `.decapod/` directly; use Decapod CLI surfaces for generated specs, data, workspaces, and sessions.

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo install decapod

decapod validate
decapod docs ingest
decapod session acquire
decapod rpc --op agent.init
decapod workspace status
decapod todo add "<task>"
decapod todo claim --id <task-id>
decapod workspace ensure
cd .decapod/workspaces/<your-worktree>
decapod rpc --op context.resolve
```

## Control-Plane First

```bash
decapod capabilities --format json
decapod rpc --op context.scope --params '{"query":"<problem>","limit":8}'
decapod data schema --deterministic
```

## Operating Mode

- Use Docker git workspaces and execute in `.decapod/workspaces/*`.
- Call `decapod workspace status` at startup and before implementation work.
- request elevated permissions before Docker/container workspace commands.
- `.decapod files are accessed only via decapod CLI`.
- Read and update `.decapod/config.toml` as project context; use Decapod CLI for other `.decapod/` state.
- Read `.decapod/OVERRIDE.md` for repo-local constitution overrides when present.
- `DECAPOD_SESSION_PASSWORD` is required for session-scoped operations.
- Read canonical router: `decapod docs show core/DECAPOD.md`.
- Use shared aptitude memory for human-taught preferences across sessions/providers: `decapod data memory add|get` (aliases: `decapod data aptitude`).
- Operator reference: `decapod docs show docs/PLAYBOOK.md`.
- Capability authority: `decapod capabilities --format json`.
- Scoped context feature: `decapod docs search --query "<problem>" --op <op>` or `decapod rpc --op context.scope`.

Stop if requirements are ambiguous or conflicting.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
